![Project preview](src/assets/preview.jpg)

## Overview

Front-end implementation of the Space Tourism multi-page website challenge. The app is built as a vanilla JavaScript single-page application using client-side routing, layered CSS, and data-driven rendering.

- **Live Demo**: [Space Tourism Website](https://ammar-taha.github.io/space-tourism-website/)
- **Challenge**: [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3)

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the dev server URL shown in the terminal (defaults to `http://localhost:5173`).

## Key Features

- SPA navigation powered by a minimal History API router
- Modular page controllers (`src/pages/`) and shared UI components
- Data sourced from `src/data.json` via a lightweight service layer
- Responsive layouts with CSS `@layer` organization and scoped page overrides

For detailed structure and architectural decisions, see `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
